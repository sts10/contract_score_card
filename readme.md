### An interactive score card for a card game called Contract Rummy.  

This little app is live at [http://samschlinkert.com/contract/](http://samschlinkert.com/contract/).

If you don't know the game here is [one version of rules](http://www.pagat.com/rummy/ctrummy.html). 

Also, I wrote a short [blog post](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2014/05/21/interactive-score-card/) about my processs building it.
